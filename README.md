# K-nearest neighbors algorithm

This code implements a machine learning workflow for classifying wine samples using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 

It begins by loading the built-in Wine dataset from scikit-learn, which contains chemical analysis measurements of wines from three different cultivars. The feature data (X) and target labels (y) are extracted, where X represents the numerical measurements of wine characteristics and y contains the class labels (0, 1, 2) corresponding to different wine types.

The data is then split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 ratio, with 30% of the data reserved for testing the model's performance. A KNN classifier is instantiated with 3 neighbors and trained on the training data. The model makes predictions on the test set, and these predictions are compared to the actual labels through a confusion matrix.

The confusion matrix is computed to evaluate the classifier's performance, showing correct predictions along the diagonal and misclassifications in the off-diagonal cells. Finally, the code creates a visual representation of the confusion matrix using a heatmap from the Seaborn library. The heatmap is annotated with numerical values, formatted with red lines between cells, and includes appropriate axis labels and a title.
